	<p><span>Lemmy</span> has such a personal relationship with his equipment that he's actually named his amps.<br> He's called them "Murder One," "No Remorse," "Marsha" and "Killer." Marshall<br> later specially designed a "Murder One" amp in 2006.

The 1992LEM <br>is a faithful replica of Lemmy''s favored model 1992 Super Bass Head<br> from1976, affectionately named "Murder One." Lemmy''s original amp<br> was in the studio and on the road for over 30 years, until Marshall <br>presented him with 1992LEM prototypes for Motörhead''s 2007-8<br> tour and Murder One went into a well-deserved retirement. The new<br> 1992LEM captures the look, feel, sound and power of Murder One,<br> as well as Lemmy and his legendary band Motörhead.<br>

Lemmy has long been an ardent supporter of Marshall <br>products and a personal friend of company founder <br>Dr. Jim Marshall, OBE. "Marshall amps and speakers<br> have stood behind me on every continent," he stated. <br>"I have never found anyone better to have at my back.<br> If it has Marshall written on it, you can buy it<br> without even a test drive - they''re that good."</p>
