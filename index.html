	<p><span>Lemmy Kilmister</span>, (Ian Fraser Kilmister), British musician (born Dec. 24, 1945, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, Eng.—died Dec. 28, 2015, Los Angeles, Calif.), founded, fronted, and was the only constant member of the hard-rock band Motörhead. He played the bass guitar, using distorted sound and chords befitting a rhythm guitar, and he sang, usually with his head tilted up into the microphone, with raw guttural intensity. Motörhead’s music was both unrelentingly fast and loud enough to rattle teeth, and it was often described as speed metal or thrash metal, genres of hard rock that Kilmister was credited as having pioneered. Kilmister began playing rhythm guitar with rock bands in the mid-1960s, and he worked briefly as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix. In 1971 he became the bass guitarist for the psychedelic hard-rock band Hawkwind. Kilmister provided the vocals for Hawkwind’s most successful single, “Silver Machine,” which in 1972 reached the number three spot on the British charts. He was ejected (1975) from the group, however, after he was arrested in Canada on drug charges while the band was on tour. He formed Motörhead the same year. The band’s second and third releases, Overkill and Bomber (both 1979), reached the top 20 on British charts. Ace of Spades (1980) was the first Motörhead LP that was also released in the United States, and both the album and its title track found a following among American headbangers. The 1981 live album No Sleep ’til Hammersmith entered the British charts at number one. Motörhead went on to release some 20 more albums (the last one, Bad Magic, in 2015), most of which were among the top hard-rock sellers, and Kilmister and his bandmates played live shows for the better part of each of nearly 40 years, performing before reliably packed houses.</p>
